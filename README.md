# FillBD2

FillBD2 is a tool (for Linux) to find a set of files whose total size is as close as possible below a defined size. 
This defined size is usually determined by an external medium such as DVD or BlueRay.

The goal is to fill this external media to the maximum or in other words: find a file compilation, which leaves no unused space on the disc.


FillBD2 requires a **Python interpreter** in version 2.7.x.

The GUI requires **wxWidgets** (or wxPython) in version 2.8.

As database **sqlite3** is used.

Other tools needed are:
for mkudffs:
  **udftools-1.0.0b3-153.1.1.x86_64**
for genisoimage:
  **genisoimage-1.1.11-8.1.2.x86_64**
for encrypted containers:
  **realcrypt-7.0a-3.80.x86_64**
